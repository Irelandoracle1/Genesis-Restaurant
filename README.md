# Layout
-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used throughout the website include include: Black, Lavender and blue  
    
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery was chosen to go with the website's colour and content theme. I'm using dining and restaurant interior images with deep-toned, soothing colours and attractive graphics. For the edit, delete and logout page I'm using images with graphics that signal what will happen if user edits, deletes or signs out.

*   ### Wireframes
    -   #### Discrepancy with original ideas
        -   I originally intended to create my own HTML pages and CSS styling, however, I decided to use a standard Bootstrap theme instead, which saved me a huge amount of time. I simply followed the theme layout, customized text labels for various forms, so the original wireframes were not used at all. As the theme is fully responsive, I didn't create mobile device wireframes after deciding to use Bootstrap. By using a Boostrap theme, my theme is more unified, too. I also created a menu page for the site, which wasn't in my original plans.
